We truly appreciate your loyalty to FastComet. I’d be glad to clarify your questions about our VPS Cloud 3 plan and the difference between Managed and Unmanaged VPS options.\\n\\n1. Managed vs. Unmanaged VPS\\n\\nManaged VPS\\nOur technical team fully maintains the server for you. This includes software updates, security, performance tuning, backups, and 24/7 monitoring. You can focus on running your websites and development while we take care of the server’s health and uptime.\\n\\n2. Unmanaged VPS\\nYou get full root access and complete control over the server configuration, but you are responsible for all maintenance tasks, software installation, updates, security patches, and troubleshooting.\\n\\n3. Control, Support, and Maintenance\\n\\nManaged VPS: Full support from our SysAdmin team with proactive monitoring, automatic backups, and priority technical assistance. Root access is not available for stability and security, but you will have full WHM/cPanel access for website management.\\n\\nUnmanaged VPS: Full root access and complete freedom to configure the server as you wish, but no active management or monitoring from our side. Support is limited to hardware and network availability.\\n\\n4. Root Access and Permissions\\n\\nOn a Managed VPS, root access is not available to prevent conflicts with the server management layer. You’ll still be able to:\\n\\nManage websites, databases, and email accounts through WHM/cPanel.\\n\\nCreate new accounts, install SSLs, and adjust PHP versions.\\n\\nHowever, you won’t be able to:\\n\\nModify core OS or kernel settings.\\n\\nInstall custom software that may interfere with our management configuration.\\n\\nOn an Unmanaged VPS, you’ll have full root access with no restrictions.\\n\\n5. Website & Database Migration\\nYes, we’ll be happy to handle the full migration of your websites, databases, and email accounts from your current hosting account. The duration depends on the total data size.\\n\\n6. DNS Configuration & Propagation\\nWe can assist you with DNS configuration during migration, including updating nameservers or DNS zones (if your domain is managed with us). Once DNS changes are made, propagation typically takes 2–24 hours, depending on your registrar and global caching.\\n\\n7. Installing Other Languages & Services\\nOn a Managed VPS, we can install and enable environments such as Node.js, Python.\\nOn an Unmanaged VPS, you can also install additional services like Redis, Elasticsearch, or Docker, as you’ll have full system control.\\n\\n8. cPanel Availability on Unmanaged VPS\\nYes, you can purchase and install cPanel/WHM on an Unmanaged VPS.\\n\\n9. VPS Resource Allocation\\nAll VPS plans, including VPS Cloud 3, come with fully dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage resources that are reserved exclusively for your account. The underlying network infrastructure is shared, but your server resources are guaranteed.\\n\\n10. Pricing & Discounts\\n\\nAs a valued FastComet customer since 2021, you may be eligible for a loyalty or upgrade discount. Once you confirm which VPS type you’d like to proceed with, I can forward your request to our sales team to secure the best possible offer.\\n\\nPlease let us know your preferred VPS option, and we’ll prepare a personalized quote and migration plan for you.\\n\\nThank you again for being part of the FastComet family. We’re excited to help you upgrade smoothly to a VPS environment.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nIwan\", \"a few seconds ago\\n from IP 202.58.196.49\"]','cmhty86rl0000ooon6j5qix5j','2025-11-12 04:19:17.720','2025-11-12 04:25:32.643','https://admin.worldhost.group/admin/support/inbox/96e02e51-36d4-20d1-d2d2-c1429807875d?_gl=1%2a1629xqe%2a_up%2aMQ..%2a_ga%2aMTUzNDU4MDA5Ny4xNzYyOTExMTg1%2a_ga_KLRWZFRZE4%2aczE3NjI5MTExODQkbzEkZzAkdDE3NjI5MTExODQkajYwJGwwJGgw'),('BIN-837-62259__day__2025-11-13','Stablepoint','Mary Falbo','Email','Iwan Setiawan','Email','Awaiting Response','Nov 8th 07:59 AM\n from IP 2600:4040:7fd0:1f00:acfe:b482:f78c:8c2','2025-11-13','[\"We are fine!!!

However, please allow us to explain why payment extensions are not typically possible when it comes to domain names.\\n\\nDomain renewals are processed in real-time through global domain registries, which are the official organizations responsible for managing domain name systems worldwide. Once a domain is renewed, the registry immediately applies the renewal and marks it as active. This process is automated and irreversible.\\n\\nBecause of this real-time, non-reversible nature, domain providers like us must collect payment upfront and cannot delay or extend payment deadlines. We are required to follow strict registry rules to ensure domain ownership is maintained and that no disruption occurs in your domain’s availability.\\n\\nThis is not a policy unique to our platform—it is an industry-wide standard enforced by all accredited domain registrars.\\n\\nWe hope this provides clarity, and we’re more than happy to assist you with any alternative solutions or answer further questions you may have.\\n\\nRegards,\\nIvan\", \"7 hours ago\\n from IP 103.18.65.51\"]','cmhty86rl0000ooon6j5qix5j','2025-11-13 03:56:50.418','2025-11-13 03:57:38.185','https://admin.worldhost.group/admin/support/inbox/3e8d569d-0724-563d-0580-fd4e85312160'),('BQG-644-66891__day__2025-11-12','hosting.com','Aaron Tardos','AutoSSL problem','Iwan Setiawan','Website','Awaiting Response','9 minutes ago\n from IP 74.222.230.14','2025-11-12','[\"Hello,\\n\\nPlease see the attached PDF.\\n\\nI received this email today.\\n\\nWhat should I do about it?\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nAaron\", \"9 minutes ago\\n from IP 74.222.230.14\"]','[\"Hi Aaron,\\n\\nThank you for your message and for forwarding the AutoSSL notification.\\n\\nThe message refers to the subdomain mail.recommendedphotoequipment.com, which currently does not have a valid DNS record pointing to your hosting server.

This is absolute proof that the browser did not receive any HTTP status response from your server—not even a 404 or a 500—because the connection was killed before the server application could reply.\\n\\nConclusion: The combination of ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED and zero response headers is the definitive signature of an IP-level block applied by a security appliance (like CSF) guarding your network.\\n\\nThe block is highly persistent and occurs when my IP changes between 78.147.133.39 and 78.147.135.166. This confirms you are blocking a wider IP range (a CIDR block) associated with my ISP.\\nTo resolve this permanently, you must investigate and unblock the entire affected CIDR block, not just a single IP.\\n\\nPlease proceed with the immediate unblock and billing correction detailed in my previous email.\\n\\nKind regards,\\n\\nJulian\\n\\n________________________________\\nFrom: hosting.com Support <support@hosting.com>\\nSent: 10 November 2025 10:00\\nTo: Julian MANDERS-JONES <mandersjones@hotmail.com>\\nSubject: New Support Ticket Message - SZD-272-55259 - LC - Can\'t access Client Area\\n\\n[hosting.com]<https://my.hosting.com/login>\\nHi Julian,\\n\\nThis is a reply to ticket SZD-272-55259 from Teodora L..\\n\\nThe ticket subject is LC - Can\'t access Client Area\\n\\n---\\nHello Julian,\\n\\nThank you for your patience!\\n\\nCould you please provide us with a screenshot of your network tab when the issue occurs, along with your browser version and the Operating System you are using?\\n\\nThis information will help us further investigate the root cause of the issue.\\n\\nWe are looking forward to your response.\\n\\nKind Regards,\\nTeodora L.\\n---\\n\\nIf you wish to reply to this email please keep the subject line intact.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nhosting.com\", \"7 hours ago\\n via \\nemail\", \"Dear A2 Hosting Support Team,\\n\\nThe time spent debugging your service must now end.

Please allow me to clarify each point and outline our next steps.\\n\\n1. Regarding the Payment\\nThe recent charge was processed automatically under the auto-renewal setting, which renews services using the saved card on file to prevent interruption. I understand this was unexpected, particularly while your access has been limited.\\nIf the renewal was unintentional, you can request a refund review through our billing team. However, before we proceed, we’ll need you to regain access to your account so that ownership and service details can be securely verified. Once you’re logged in, we can escalate your refund request immediately.\\n\\n2. Account Access / Lock-Out Issue\\nAfter reviewing your account, we haven’t identified any blocks or restrictions on your IP from our side. To help isolate the issue, please try accessing your Client Area again at https://my.hosting.com/login using a VPN connection, such as https://one.one.one.one/ or any preferred VPN provider.\\nIn addition, please check your local environment for any restrictions that may interfere with the login process. This can include antivirus software, active firewall rules, or browser extensions that might block secure connections. Temporarily disabling these (if safe to do so) or whitelisting our site can often resolve similar issues.\\nOnce you regain access, kindly let us know so we can proceed with the next steps regarding your billing concern.\\n\\n3. Escalation and Ongoing Review\\nYour case remains under review by our senior technical team. So far, we have not detected any server-side restrictions, but our team continues to investigate. We’ll update you as soon as additional details are available.\\n\\nJulian, I truly understand how disruptive this has been and want to assure you that your case is being treated with urgency. Our priority is to help restore your access so that we can move forward with addressing the payment concern quickly and transparently.\\n\\nThank you for your continued patience and understanding.\\n\\nKind regards,\\nIwan\\nSupport Team\", \"a few seconds ago\\n from IP 202.58.196.49\", \"Client was on chat and seeks a quick resolution to this issue. has been 3 days since he has been unable to access the Client Portal Area.\", \"4 hours ago\\n from IP 185.149.115.6\", \"updated the thread in general, with browser and OS versions along with screenshot with the network tab.\", \"5 hours ago\\n from IP 66.85.157.146\", \"Hello Julian,\\n\\nI appreciate your patience thus far.\\n\\nI have provided the OS and browser information you provided, along with the screenshot, to our team.

However, since the new primary domain will point to the same public_html directory, your website may require a few configuration updates (such as adjusting WordPress settings, configuration files, or database URLs) to ensure laser-travel.com correctly loads your existing site content.\\n\\nAs laser-travel.com is currently hosted under a different cPanel account, please note that this update will not affect that existing setup. However, before we proceed, make sure that laser-travel.com is not added as an addon domain or alias under your current laser-travel.com.np account.

Agent Usman H. confirmed the change can proceed but highlighted key points: all email and FTP accounts linked to the old domain will be lost, the new domain must not exist as an addon, and content will load from the public_html folder.

I\'m happy to assist you.\\n\\nWe can change the primary domain name from laser-travel.com.np to laser-travel.com. However, please note and confirm the following before we proceed.\\n\\n1- All email and FTP accounts linked with laser-travel.com.np will be lost. They will change from @laser-travel.com.np to @laser-travel.com\\n2- Please make sure laser-travel.com does not exist in your cPanel as an addon or domain alias else it can not be made the primary domain name of your hosting account.\\n3- Once laser-travel.com is made the main domain, it will load its content from the public_html folder. You may need to consult a developer to make laser-travel.com work with old content.\\n4- If you have a paid SSL, the SSL vendor will not rename it, so you may have to purchase a new paid SSL for similar coverage. Domains with free SSLs will have a new SSL issued automatically within a few hours of DNS propagation of the new domain name.\\n\\nYour username and password will not be affected by this change. Your site may be unavailable for up to 24 hours during this process.\\n\\nRemember, our scope of services is limited to the server level only.

I am not sure what happened, but we\\nwant to make sure they are on their own account. It is fine if they are\\nwith ours right now to make sure all sites remain up until this is sorted\\nout properly on the back end.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe accounts are www.lockebridge.com <http://www.lockebridge.com> and\\nwww.scott-waxler.com <http://www.scott-waxler.com> . They seem to currently\\nstill be part of our StrayAngel.com package, and they did migrate over as\\nsub-accounts when our old server was closed down.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease let me know how they\'re set up so I can make sure the account holder\\nof these two accounts, Scott Waxler, who owns these websites has their own\\nsetup with Hosting.com. My support pin is 323026. The primary domain on\\nour account is strayangel.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe want to tell Mr. Waxler who owns these two account and domains what he\\nneeds to do to make sure his accounts are separate from ours so in case our\\npackage is moved or changed, he is not affected. I think the issue that\\nhappened was his accounts were on our old legacy server that is gone now and\\nso they somehow got placed back with our account with all our other\\naccounts.\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease let me know what is best. Scott Waxler tried to call in today but no\\none would talk to him as he could not access any hosting.com login info or\\nprovide any support pin. He was supposed to or used to have his own login\\nto hosting.com and PIN, etc.\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for your help.\\n\\n\\n\\nBest,\\n\\n\\n\\nSuren\\n\\n\\n\\nSuren M.
